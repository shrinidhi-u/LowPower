**Remarks:**
- The *all.vhi* file can be loaded in Onespin to load the complete property suite.
- Source the *run.tcl* file in Onespin. Change the first line in the *run.tcl* file to point to either *Opt* or *Orig* in order to verify the corresponding design.
- The property suite should hold on both, the original and optimized design, demonstrating sequential equivalence of the two designs.
