**Remarks:**
- The *quicksort_verif.vhi* file contains the properties that verify the design.
- The *completeness_quicksort.vhi* file contains the completeness information.
- Source the "run.tcl" file in Onespin. Change the first line in the "run.tcl" file to point to either "Opt" or "Orig" in order to verify the corresponding design.
- The property suite should hold on both, the original and optimized design, demonstrating sequential equivalence of the two designs.
